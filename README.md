    For the BAE 305 project, the group desided to create a miniture vending machine. This system works like most vending machines: a button will select a product and, through a despending system, the product will be giving to the user. In this case, the despending system is a conglomerate of funnels and gears that use gravity to pull the wanted item down to the user. These wanted productes for the user are four differnet types of candies (Skittels, M&Ms, Reeses Pieces, and 4th). Each gear and funnel system is activated by a specilized button (four in total). Collectively, the 
    Overall, each candy is placed in its own funnel. When a specific candy's button is pushed, an attached LCD screen will display the candy selected while the gear under that funnel will spin half a rotation, giving the user a handfull of that candy while reblocking that funnel from allowing more candy to fall. A ramp positioned below all four gear systems will lead the candy to one location, so that the user can collect the candy in their hand.
