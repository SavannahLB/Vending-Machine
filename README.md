    DONE
For the BAE 305 project, a miniature vending machine was created. This system works like most vending machines: a button will select a product leading to a dispensing system giving said product to the user. In this case, the dispensing system is a conglomerate of funnels and gears that use gravity to pull the wanted item down to the user. These products for the user are four different types of candies (Skittles, M&Ms, Reeses Pieces, and 4th). A specilized button (four in total) activates one of four gears, allowing candy to flow from the attached funnel system. Overall, each candy is placed in its funnel. When the specific candy's button is pushed, an attached LCD screen will display the candy selected while the gear attached to a DC toy motor and positioned under the funnel will spin half a rotation. This will give the user a handful of that candy while reblocking that funnel, stopping more candy from falling. A ramp positioned below all four gear systems will lead the candy to one location so the user can collect the candy in their hand. When assembled, the machine was tested multiple times to get the correct spin of the gear and candy ratio for the user. After assembly, the miniature vending machine functions as intended, as listed in the project backlog.
